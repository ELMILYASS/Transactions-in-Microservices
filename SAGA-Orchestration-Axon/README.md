Below is a collection of additional repositories that explore different methods for managing transactions in a microservices architecture.

Each repository in this collection demonstrates a different approach:

1. **SAGA Pattern with Kafka (Orchestration)**  
   Repository: [SAGA-Orchestration-Kafka](https://github.com/ELMILYASS/SAGA-Orchestration-Kafka)  
   This implementation uses the SAGA orchestration pattern to manage distributed transactions, with **Kafka** as the messaging platform.

2. **SAGA Pattern with Kafka (Choreography)**  
   Repository: [SAGA-Choreography-Kafka](https://github.com/ELMILYASS/SAGA-Choreography-Kafka)  
   This implementation uses the SAGA choreography pattern to manage distributed transactions, with **Kafka** as the messaging platform.

3. **SAGA Orchestration with Axon Framework**  
   Repository: [SAGA-Orchestration-Axon](https://github.com/ELMILYASS/SAGA-Orchestration-Axon)  
   A simple orchestration-based workflow using the Saga pattern and Axon framework

4. **Saga Orchestration with Propagation**  
   Repository: [Saga-Orchestration-Propagation](https://github.com/ELMILYASS/Saga-Orchestration-Propagation)  
   A simple demonstration showing how transaction propagation works in microservices using the orchestration saga pattern.
5. **Spring Reactive WebFlux for Reactive Microservices**  
   Repository: [Spring-Reactive-Web-Flux](https://github.com/ELMILYASS/Spring-Reactive-Web-Flux)  
   A project demonstrating the capabilities of Reactive Spring through the utilization of Spring Web Flux.

6. **CQRS and Event Sourcing with Axon**  
   Repository: [CQRS-EventSourcing-Axon](https://github.com/ELMILYASS/CQRS-EventSourcing-Axon)  
   This project provides a clear illustration of the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing patterns, employing the Axon Framework.
